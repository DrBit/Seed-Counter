*********************************************

TODO

Change the handling of movements in manual mode. (Diff speeds depending on how long you press the button)

New sensors 
	Sense if a blister correctly placed in the X axis conveier (Also works for empty blisters)
	Sensor need to be positioned in a way that will also sense when the blister is offset
	
	Sensor for printer, lable printed and placed correctly

Relay board for on off

Handle motors sleep / reset and enable
	Create functions sleep
	Emergency stop
