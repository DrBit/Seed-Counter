**  * Starting process of implementing communication with network module 
**
**  V2.1.13 - 28/09/2011

**	* Increased range of detection of seeds in the counter
**	* Addes some motor parameters definitions in setup (Acceleration and speed defaults)
**  * Added label printer init function
**
**  V2.1.12 - 20/09/2011 
**	* Merged branch acceleration
**  * Fine tune positions in the prototype
**  * Serial speed changed to maxim
**
**  V2.1.11 - 20/09/2011  (new branch)
**  * Changed acceleration metoth 
**  * Updated library to V1.2 (acceleration in motors)
**
**  V2.1.10 - 17/09/2011
**	* Updated hardcode of positions into solid state memory
**
**  V2.1.9 - 15/09/2011
**  * Updated positions for blisters
**  * Releas blisters function improved
**  * Improved pause button
**
**  V2.1.8 - 14/09/2011
**  * Changed behavior of the INIT counter procedure to match new counting system (with vibration from the same wheel)
**  * Optimized parameters in counter and blister dispenser
**  * Updated Library to V1.1 (fixed bug) 
**
**  V2.1.7 - 07/09/2011
**  * Added Vibrator in TEST menu (later removed)
**
**  V2.1.6 - 31/08/2011
**  * Sensor PIN B changed from 13 to 4 (due to problems with led conected in pin 13 via hardware)
**  * Removed "go to position X Y" function and included into library, now available for all motors
**  * Updatedlibrary to V1.0
**
**  V2.1.5 - 25/08/2011
**  * Fixed bug in motors handling that would prevent moving small number of steps in motor modes 1,2 and 4 
**    due to lack of resolution.
**  * Implemented function "go to position X Y" (for now only for X motor). The function will determine how to move
**  * the motor in order to go to the specific position with the better possible way (added in test menu).
**  * Added Version tracking to warn user when working whith an outdatet version of the library (from version 0.6.3)
**
**  V2.1.4 - 23/08/2011
**  * Adapted function pick a seed for the new hardware
**  * Implemented DEBUG function
**  * Created new motors handling function. For now with fixed acceleration and only for X motor (Test option in Menu)
**
**  V2.1.3 - 18/08/2011
**  * Added testing menu function
**  * Changed init order of motors to first init the blisters
**  * Added counter manual mode + print position
**  * Added file "Label_printer.pde"
**
**  V2.1.2 - 17/08/2011
**  * Added "press_button_to_continue(int button_number)" and "return_pressed_button ()" in extra fucntions
**  * Fixed bugs in XY axis init process.
**  * Added main menu with function show sensor status
**  * Implemented counter init procedure
**  * Added a full error control sistem in init procedures
**  * Added serial compatibility when pressing buttons 1,2,3
**  * Changed names of the main files 
**    "Stepper_ac06.h" -> "Stepper_ac.h" /  "Seed_counterV2.1.pde" -> "Seed_counter.pde"
**
**  V2.1.1 - 11/08/2011
**  * Added control of the axis limits in manual mode to avoid going to far and damaging the sensors 
**    or going off limits.
**  * Added Manual mode for the blisters dispenser
**  * Changed to the new library version 0.6 "Stepper_ac06.h"
**
**  V2.1.0 - 10/08/2011
**  * Merging code from previous motor testings
**  * Created new set of functions for controlling blister's motors "blisters.pde"
**  * Implemented error checking system in XY motors init algorithm. Depured code.
**  * Added velocity control of the motors. MS1,MS2 conencted from Arduino to the "easy driver" 
**    (functions included in library "Stepper_ac05.h")
**  *
**  V2.0 - 27/06/2011

TODO

INIT X somtime fails, recheck that

Config menu with:
	Network configuration (Dynnamic addresses ports,...)
	*Network Batch ID selector
	Positions Configurations (Re-set any position)
	Change the handling of movements in manual mode. (Diff speeds depending on how long you press the button)

New sensors 
	Sense when the blisters are empty
	Sense if a blister correctly placed in the X axis conveier
	
Automatic reset of network module

Speed up the counter wheel
